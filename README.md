## Welcome to the University of Louisville Investment Club

This is the repository for the main website. Here you can find the process that I have taken to compile web sources and elements to create a static website for the investment club. The reason that I decided to make the website on my own instead of looking for an online website builder is because I believe in the process of learning a skill and applying it to a goal. I wanted a space to direct individuals for outreach as well as
a space to hold club info. Also, by creating a home website it allows the club to take more shape and have a greater presence online.
