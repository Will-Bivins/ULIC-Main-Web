## Welcome to the University of Louisville Investment Club

This is the repository for the main website. Here you can find the process that I have taken to compile web sources and elements to create a static website for the investment club. The reason that I decided to make the website on my own instead of looking for an online website builder is because I'm based and need to do things the hard way. No I am not a web design major.
