            About the Club
            <hr class="solid">
        </h2>
        <p>
            The University of Louisville Investment Club (ULIC) is a student run, organized, and managed RSO residing in
            the College of Business. At it’s core, the ULIC is a space for students and young adults to collaborate on
            market research and strengthen their understanding of the stock market, influential companies, financial
            analysis, and financial markets. We believe that through
            collaboration and the exchange of ideas, students are able to gain independence in their financial planning,
            competence in financial and economic analysis, as well as collaborate experience in a professional setting.

        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the ULIC also hosts various guest speakers to share information about their professional field
            with club members. This allows members to gain better knowledge and scope on financial professions. We
            believe that providing students external insight into market planning provides a crucial resource to
            understanding careers in which our research is applicable.


        </p>
        <p>
            The University of Louisville Investment Club's primary mission is to create an environment where students
            can learn about the stock market and investment planning through hands-on research and financial analysis.
            As part of its <strong>publication process,</strong>
            the club produces weekly financial reports on various market sectors. This research helps students develop
            analytical skills while learning valuable organization and collaboration techniques.

            Publication Process
            <hr class="solid">
        </h2>
        <p>
            The goal of the University of Louisville Investment Club is to provide meaningful, accurate, and insightful information
            to it's members and the student body as a whole. It is meant to be a Informational Resource to its student
            body while also providing educational experience to club members.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Club publishes weekly sector reports, each focused on a specific sector of the market and produced by
            one of our six sector committees. These committees are led by elected chairs who oversee research, ensure
            information accuracy, and coordinate the report’s compilation and release. These publications will target a
            topic in the respective sector of the committee producing them. The publications will often target specific
            events, companies, recent relative policy changes, or anything that is deemed meaningful or significant by
            the club.


        </p>
        <p>
            These publications are intended to be a platform for student-led market research.
