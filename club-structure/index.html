            The University of Louisville Investment Club (ULIC) is a student run, organized, and managed RSO residing in
            the College of Business. At it’s core, the ULIC is a space for students and young adults to collaborate on
            market research and strengthen their understanding of the stock market. We believe that through
            collaboration and the exchange of ideas, students are able to gain independence through knowledge and
            prepare themselves for personal financial planning, or find new concepts to use in their careers in
            investment planning.

        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the ULIC also hosts various guest speakers to share information about their professional field
            with club members. This allows members to gain better knowledge and scope on financial professions. We
            believe that providing students external insight into market planning provides a crucial resource to
            understanding the

            The University of Louisville Investment Club's primary mission is to create an environment where students

            the club produces weekly financial reports on various market sectors. This research helps students develop
            analytical skills while learning valuable organization and collaboration techniques.
